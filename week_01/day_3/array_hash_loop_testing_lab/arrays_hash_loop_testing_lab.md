# Arrays, Hashes, Loops and Testing Lab

## Learning Objectives
- Practice using arrays, hashes and loops in functions.
- Practice testing.

This lab is designed to help you understand using arrays, hashes and loops in functions.

We have provided you with some pre-written tests in `my_functions_spec.rb`, you will need to write the code to make them pass.
You should not have to change the tests to make them pass.
